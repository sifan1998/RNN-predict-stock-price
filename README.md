This project is using RNN to predict the stock price, a simple RNN model and a LSTM RNN model were built to predict the stock price.
The ipynb file shows the code, the pdf file shows the priciple, the csv file is the real data of a stock.
Although it seems that LSTM performs well on predicting stock price, it only uses a value very close to the price of the previous day as the forecast value of the next day.
Using RNN to predict stock price is not viable.
