This project is using RNN to predict the stock price, a simple RNN model and a LSTM RNN model were built to predict the stock price.
The ipynb file shows the code and the pdf file shows the priciple.
Although it seems that LSTM performs well on predicting stock price, it only uses a value very close to the price of the previous day as the forecast value of the next day.
Using RNN to predict stock price is not viable.
